AWS provides different types of Load Balancers under the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service, which helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

*Types of Load Balancers in AWS*
AWS offers three main types of load balancers:

1️⃣ Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer).
Routes traffic based on HTTP/HTTPS requests.
Supports host-based, path-based, and query-based routing.
Ideal for microservices & containerized applications.
Supports WebSockets and integrates with AWS services like Lambda.
Use case: Websites, REST APIs, microservices, and containerized apps (ECS, EKS).

2️⃣ Network Load Balancer (NLB)
Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer).
Handles TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.
Can handle millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency.
Preserves the client's original IP address.
Supports sticky sessions based on source IP.
Use case: High-performance applications, gaming, financial services, real-time streaming.

3️⃣ Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer).
Used for inspecting and filtering traffic before reaching the target.
Ideal for third-party security appliances (firewalls, intrusion detection).
Provides transparent bump-in-the-wire traffic flow.
Use case: Security appliances like firewalls, DDoS protection, network monitoring.

Key Features of AWS Load Balancers
✔ Auto Scaling: Adjusts the number of instances behind the load balancer.
✔ SSL Termination: Offloads SSL/TLS encryption to the load balancer.
✔ Sticky Sessions: Keeps a user's session bound to a specific target.
✔ Cross-Zone Load Balancing: Distributes traffic evenly across multiple AZs.
✔ Health Checks: Detects and removes unhealthy instances from the target group.
✔ Integration with AWS Services: Works with EC2, ECS, Lambda, WAF, CloudFront, etc.
