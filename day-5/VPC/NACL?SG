In AWS, when multiple security groups are attached to an EC2 instance and they have conflicting rules, the most permissive rule takes effect. Security groups work as stateful firewalls, meaning:

Allow Rules Are Cumulative:

If one security group allows traffic on port 22 (SSH) and another denies it, the connection is still allowed because AWS security groups do not support explicit "deny" rules.
AWS evaluates all attached security groups and applies the most permissive rule.
Egress Rules Apply Similarly:

If one security group allows outbound traffic to a certain IP but another does not specify anything, the outbound traffic is still allowed.
No Explicit Deny in Security Groups:

Unlike Network ACLs (NACLs), which support explicit deny rules, security groups only contain "allow" rules.
If no rule is present to allow traffic, it is implicitly denied.
Example Scenario:
Security Group 1: Allows inbound SSH (port 22) from 0.0.0.0/0.

Security Group 2: Does not have any rule for SSH.

Result: SSH is allowed, because the most permissive rule applies.

Security Group 1: Allows inbound HTTP (port 80) from 0.0.0.0/0.

Security Group 2: Allows inbound HTTP (port 80) from 10.0.0.0/24.
